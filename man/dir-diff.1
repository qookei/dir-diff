.SS "Input control:"
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-ignore\fR=\fI\,PATTERN\/\fR
ignore all paths that match the specified pattern,
relative to the source paths, that is, when comparing
/a/ and /b/, these prefixes are not included; can be specified
multiple times to add multiple patterns (a file being ignored
if any of them matches); see glob(7) for pattern syntax
.SS "Output control:"
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-no\-legend\fR

.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-git\-diff\fR=\fI\,DEPTH\/\fR
generate a patch file with 'git diff \fB\-\-no\-index\fR' for
every pair of differing directories at the given depth
(0 being children of the '<root>' node)
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-prune\fR=\fI\,PATTERN\/\fR
do not show the inner differences of directories whose
paths match the specified pattern, relative to the source paths,
that is, when comparing /a/ and /b/, these prefixes are not included;
can be specified multiple times to add multiple patterns (a diff being
pruned if any of them matches); see glob(7) for pattern syntax

\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-no\-default\-prune\fR
do not add default prune patterns (".git" and "**/.git") to the
prune list
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-max\-depth\fR=\fI\,DEPTH\/\fR
